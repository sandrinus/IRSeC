# Yo, so create CSV file in format that is listed below. You don't need to input all domains for each user (I hope).
# It will check the domain at the beginning of the program and should input the domain name for you. Then it just runs.
# If you need a pause for longer than 5 minutes, change it at the bottom. Button, bottom, bottun... screw it, I'm SCOTTISH!
# I honestly don't know if it's even going to work
