Import-Module ActiveDirectory  # Loads the Active Directory module to enable AD user management functions

#Yo, so create csv file in format that is listed below. YOu don't need to input all domains for each users(I hope)
#it will check domain in the begining of the program and should input domain name for you. then it's just runs.
#if you need pause for longer then 5 min change it at the bottom bottum bottun fuck it i'm SCOTTISH!
#I honetly don't know if it's even going to work
